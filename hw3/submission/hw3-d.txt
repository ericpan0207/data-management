I think the only noticeable thing between sqlite and the cloud service is how fast it takes to run the queries. When I was running the queries, I wasn't really thinking about where my query went and didn't feel much of a difference from working with sqlite3. I think it's a cool idea that such a service is available on the cloud so that anyone could use it theoretically. If I was just doing some simple queries, I think I would prefer sqlite since it's lightweight and I don't have to spend time setting anything up to run something, otherwise the cloud service would be the better option.
